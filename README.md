# AlgoTrading

This repository contains my algorithmic trading practice. Under technical analysis indicators I code well known technical analysis indicators from scratch to better develop my understanding.

I fetch data from IEX in load_data.py

Currently I am working on interacting with the alpaca API in order to implement trading strategies using real-time data and buy and sell signals.
